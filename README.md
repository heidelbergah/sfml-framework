SFML 3.0 Framework designed to make game development much more organized and easier to manage and scale

## Next Steps

[x] - Add particles and particle managers
[x] - Create interpolated template for smooth transitional movements
[X] - Update GUI elements to have uploadable textures
[X] - Update Frame element to handle new widget handling
[X] - Add shader supprt + shader manager
[X] - Add camera effects: shake, movement

[] - Add a scene management system
[] - Add cutscene support; movie black bars too!
[] - Tilemap manager
    [] - Create WFC algorithm for map generation
    [] - Make JSON load/save manager

## BUGS

[] - RenderTexture stays in the same place, so when camera moves, it's obvious where
     the texture boundaries are. This is not what we want.
[] - When moving the camera, the mouse coordinate system starts being janky and no longer
     matches with what's actually being hovered over.
